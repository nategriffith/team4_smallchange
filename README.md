# Welcome to Small Change Front-end Development Project

## Description
A step in learning component-driven front-end development utilizing Storybook and Angular. This project is a self-lead journey to building the basic foundation of component driven development via the atomic-web design framework. You will learn to utilize Visual Studio Code along with HTML5, CSS, Typescript, Storybook, and Angular in phased developments starting from atoms to organisms to reinforce component-driven development. There will be opportunities to use Chrome DevTools in the Chrome web browser to test, inspect, and debug code. At the end, you will have a basic understanding of how all of these technologies tie together and will have opportunities to learn best practices as well as new skills.
